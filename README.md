# AI-Based-Smart-Food-Analyzer-Web-Application

## Problem Statement

Current dietary assessment tools, like diet recalls, lack accuracy and reliability due to 
dependence on participant memory, estimation of portion sizes, and potential misreporting. Additionally, 
there is a need for personalized dietary recommendations based on individual characteristics like vat, 
pitta, kapha state (Ayurveda), and nutrient composition. There is also a lack of motivation for users to 
adhere to their diet plans.

## Proposed solution

We aim to develop an AI-based smart food analyzer mobile application that addresses 
the limitations of existing tools. The application will enable users to track the quantity, quality, and type 
of food consumed through pictorial images. By integrating Ayurvedic principles and nutritional analysis, 
the application will generate personalized dietary charts. To enhance user engagement, gamification 
features like badges and points will be incorporated, fostering motivation and adherence to the 
prescribed diet plans. Monthly and weekly reports will be generated to provide users with a 
comprehensive overview of their dietary progress.

## Scope: 
The application will enable users to record the quantity, quality, and type of food consumed using pictorial images. It will analyse the nutritional content of the food and generate personalized dietary charts based on the user's individual characteristics and Ayurvedic principles. The application will also include gamification features to encourage adherence to the prescribed diet plans.
## System Requirements:

### Functional Requirements:
a. User Registration and Profile Management
   - Allow users to create accounts and manage their profiles.
   - Collect and store user information, including vat, pitta, and kapha states (Ayurveda) for personalized recommendations. 

b. Food Intake Tracking
   - Enable users to record their food intake by uploading pictorial images.
   - Allow users to add details such as quantity and meal time.
   - Provide an option to manually enter food information if image recognition is not feasible.

c. Nutritional Analysis
   - Analyse the nutritional content of recorded food items using AI algorithms.
   - Display information about calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), and other relevant nutritional components.

d. Personalized Dietary Recommendations
   - Generate dietary charts based on individual characteristics (vat, pitta, kapha) and nutritional requirements.
   - Provide recommendations for food choices, portion sizes, and meal timings.

e. Reports and Progress Tracking
   - Generate monthly and weekly reports summarizing the user’s food intake and adherence to the dietary plan. 
   - Display graphical representations of progress and achievements.

f. Gamification Features
   - Incorporate badges, points, and rewards system to motivate users to follow the prescribed diet plans.
   - Provide challenges and milestones to achieve for additional engagement.
### Non-Functional Requirements:

a. User Interface
   - Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
   - Ensure easy navigation and accessibility for all user types.
b. Performance
   - The application should provide quick responses and perform efficiently even with a large database of food items.

c. Security and Privacy
   - Implement secure user authentication and data encryption.
   - Comply with privacy regulation and protect user data.

d. Compatibility
   - Develop the application for both iOS and Android platforms.
   - Ensure compatibility with a range of mobile devices.

## Constraints:
•	The application will rely on accurate image recognition and nutritional analysis algorithms.
•	Reliable access to a comprehensive food database is essential for accurate tracking and analysis.
•	The Ayurvedic principles used for personalized recommendations must be validated by a certified dietitian.

## Assumptions and Dependencies:
•	Users will have access to a mobile device with a camera for capturing food images.
•	The application will require an internet connection for accessing the food database and cloud storage.

## Glossary:
Vat, Pitta, Kapha: Ayurvedic terms referring to individual constitutions based on different qualities and elements in the body.
